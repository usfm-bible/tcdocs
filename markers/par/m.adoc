\p
\v 35 As Jesus was teaching in the Temple, he asked the question, “How can the teachers
of the Law say that the Messiah will be the descendant of David?
\v 36 The Holy Spirit inspired David to say:
\q1 ‘The Lord said to my Lord:
\q2 Sit here at my right side
\q2 until I put your enemies under your feet.’
\b
