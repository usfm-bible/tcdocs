# U25008 Vid Marker

M. Hosken

Proposed for 3.2

This would add a **milestone** \\vid to indicate in USFM what the current reference is at that point and to give the current running head \\h field.

# Introduction

When working with modules or other contexts in which a fragment of scripture is to be passed, it would help if such fragments were considered true USFM documents for parsing purposes. Rather than having to insert a \\c and \\v which may or may not need to be printed, it would be easier if we had a marker for such situations. Consider the parable of the Growing Seed in Mark:9

```
\id MRK Fragment MRK 4:26-28
\vid|h="Mark" ref="MRK 4:26"\*
\s1 The Seed Growing Secretly
\p \v 26 Jesus also said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground.
\v 27 Night and day he sleeps and wakes, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he knows not how.
\v 28 All by itself the earth produces a crop—first the stalk, then the head, then grain that ripens within.
\v 29 And as soon as the grain is ripe, he swings the sickle, because the harvest has come.\f + \fr 4:29 \ft See \xt Joel 3:13,\xt* including LXX.\f*”
```

The use of \\vid here sets the current reference at that point. Whether it is set to MRK 4:26 or MRK 4:25 at that point is unimportant since the following \\v will resolve the issue. For example if the first reference is MRK 4:1 what should ref be? If it was set to MRK 3:38 then we need a chapter to increase the chapter number. Hence it is helpful to use MRK 4:1 for the reference. Notice that the same effect is achieved in USX through the use of the @vid attribute. Thus the equivalent USX might be:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<usx version="3.0">
<para style="s1" h="Mark" vid="MRK 4:26">The Seed Growing Secretly</para>
<para style="p"><verse style="v" number="26" />Jesus also said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground.
<verse style="v" number="27" />Night and day he sleeps and wakes, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he knows not how.
<verse style="v" number="28" />All by itself the earth produces a crop—first the stalk, then the head, then grain that ripens within.
</para></usx>
```

## Discussion

Move the header to a proper marker before.

```
\id MRK Fragment MRK 4:26-28
\h Introduction
\ip Mark wrote a book
\vid MRK 4:26
\s1 The Seed Growing Secretly
\p \v 26 Jesus also said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground.
\h John
\vid JHN 3:16
\v 26 For God so loved the world.
```

The problem here is that \\h is a header and is not allowed after a verse paragraph (or pretty much anything really\!)

In 3.2 this could become

```
\id MRK Fragment MRK 4:26-28
\s1|h="Mark" vid="MRK 4:26"| The Seed Growing Secretly
\p \v 26 Jesus also said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground.

```
