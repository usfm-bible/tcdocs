=== Background on USFM 3.1

USFM (Unified Scripture Format Markup) 3.1 primarily represents an effort to standardize a single xref:doc:index.adoc[content model] which can be equally expressed in backslash-based `\` format markers (USFM-FM), XML (USFM-XML), or JSON (USFM-JSON). The common abbreviation for these expressions are *USFM*, *USX*, and *USJ*.

This documentation provides a xref:ROOT:syntax-docs.adoc[summary] of markup syntax, schema diagrams, and example texts for both USFM and USX. USJ is a newer expression. Equivalent example texts in USJ are also being added.

Previous release notes (3.0 and earlier) are expressed only in USFM-FM specific terms.

=== Summary of Updates

The key differences in the grammar from USFM 3.0 to 3.1.0 are:

* xref:doc:index.adoc#doc-book-titles[BookTitles] are optional.
* xref:doc:index.adoc#doc-book-headers[BookHeaders] include xref:para:identification/sts.adoc[sts].
* xref:doc:index.adoc#doc-book-identification[BookIdentification] may be any 3 letter code (within reason).
* Other peripherals may be of any type.
* xref:doc:index.adoc#doc-book-chapter-content[Section], xref:doc:index.adoc#doc-book-chapter-content[Verse], and other xref:doc:index.adoc#doc-book-chapter-content[Para] (paragraphs) are seperated as different categories (internal).
* The xref:para:index.adoc[paragraph] #_@vid_# attribute has an extended reference syntax.
* xref:char:index.adoc[Character] markers and xref:char:nesting.adoc[nesting]:
** All xref:char:index.adoc[character] elements must be closed _explicitly_, with the exception of note structural elements (below).
** Note specific xref:char:notes/index.adoc[character] elements (i.e. `f`... xref:char:notes/footnote/fr.adoc[fr], xref:char:notes/footnote/fq.adoc[fq], xref:char:notes/footnote/ft.adoc[ft], or `x`... xref:char:notes/crossref/xo.adoc[xo], xref:char:notes/crossref/xt.adoc[xt] etc.) are considered note _submarker elements_. They provide structure to the note content. These note submarker elements continue to support (and recommend) the common pratice of implicit closure.
** Note content must occur within a submarker element; there can be no unmarked note content only within the xref:note:index.adoc[note container] itself.
** xref:char:notes/footnote/fv.adoc[fv] is now just a xref:char:notes/index.adoc[character] style and requires explicit closing.
** Use of the `\+` prefix for nested USFM xref:char:index.adoc[character] markup is supported but is _deprecated_. Note that future versions of USFM may remove support for the `\+` syntax entirely.
* Markings scripture references -- xref:char:features/ref.adoc[ref] and xref:char:notes/crossref/xt.adoc[xt]:
** Added xref:char:features/ref.adoc[ref] for marking scripture references in all contexts (including xref:char:notes/crossref/xt.adoc[xt]), with an optional machine-readable target location.
** _Deprecated_ use of the attribute #__@link-href__# with xref:char:notes/crossref/xt.adoc[xt]. Use xref:char:features/ref.adoc[ref].
** _Deprecated_ use of xref:char:notes/crossref/xt.adoc[xt] outside of xref:note:crossref/x.adoc[cross-reference]. Use: xref:char:features/ref.adoc[ref].
* Deprecate the `link-` prefix in xref:char:features/jmp.adoc[jmp] attributes.
* Add #_@key_# attribute to the xref:char:features/k.adoc[k] character element.
* #_@sid_# and #_@eid_# attributes are not automatically available for all xref:ms:index.adoc[milestones], but may be used when specified directly (e.g. xref:ms:qt.adoc[qt] and xref:ms:ts.adoc[ts])
* `\` escaping is required and supported for a number of key characters: `\`, `'`, `"`, `|`, `~`, `/`
* Whitespace rules are xref:ROOT:whitespace.adoc[clarified and formalised].

=== Revisions

* Removed `\pdi` and `\pde, and substitute with embedded text markup (see Additions, below)
* Removed `\wr ...\wr*`. This was really a duplicate of \w …w* used for marking words in the scripture text which are included in the wordlist.
* Removed `\ps`. This is used in conjunction with xref:para:paragraphs/nb.adoc[\nb] to indicate that the paragraph spans the chapter boundary. It should be sufficient to just start the new chapter with `\nb` and use the appropriate paragraph marker for the previous chapter (`\p`, `\m` etc.)
