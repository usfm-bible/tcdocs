# 3.2

- Move attribute lists to the front of the marker content and add to paragraphs,
  etc. The current position at the end is still supported for parsing. (U25001)
- Introduce @aid attribute. (U25002)
- Split the para marker category into versepara and otherpara. Disallow \v in otherpara.
- Add acknowledgement of \u and \U to the grammar. (U25004)
    - They are not expanded in the grammar. This is best done in a lexer.
- \rem ignores everything to the end of the line including other markers.
    - It is delimeted by the end of line and not the start of a new paragraph.
- Added the idea of a peripheral divided book
    - This is a file of peripheral sections or peripheral content (one big unlabelled section) 
    - These books are considered peripheral divided books: XXA-XXC, FRT, OTH, BAK, INT
    - These books are considered non divided peripheral books: CNC, GLO, TDX, NDX


# 3.1.1

- Move p1, p2 from OtherPara to PeriphPara. No longer allowed inside scripture
- Fix optbreak
- Add \ipc
- Add all of the List paragraph styles as BookIntroList prefixed with "i". Support ListChar inside.
- Add \lit to introductory paragraphs.
- Book codes must contain at least one letter
- In usfm.ext \category can have multiple space separated values. Parsers only need handle one.


# 3.1

General differences in the grammar from 3-0-5

- BookTitles are optional
- BOM is allowed
- BookIdentification may be any 3 letter code (within reason)
- Other peripherals may be of any type
- Bookheaders support \sts
- Separate out Section, Verse and Other paragraphs as different categories (internal)
- @vid has extended reference syntax
- Note content must be in a submarker, no content just in the note
- Char markers must be closed explicitly
- + is an optional embedded char maker prefix due to required closure of character markers
- \\ escaping is required and supported for a number of key characters: \\, ', ", |, ~, //
- Whitespace rules clarified and formalised
- fv is now just a character style and needs closing
